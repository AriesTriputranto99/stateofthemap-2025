By enhancing visibility and promoting social change, peacebuilding, and well-being, the project recognized and amplified the voices of marginalized communities. As a result of this project, each organization was able to build maps to recognize initiatives in Medellín associated with risk management, climate change adaptation, participation, community intangibles, urban art, and social transformation of territories.",

In this panel we will share recent success stories of cities adopting OSM-based metrics to plan better transport. We will reveal new tools that governments, mappers, and advocates can use. And we will discuss the challenges that still remain and the roles the OSM community can play in overcoming them.",
