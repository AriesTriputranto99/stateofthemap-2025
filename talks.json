How has Map Kibera and OSM had a community impact even as drones, satellite technology and AI are revolutionizing mapping? What has changed, and what has remained the same?  We will discuss the global impact of Map Kibera, on community-based mapping in OSM and on the general application of technology in developing countries.",

We'll guide participants through the process of integrating the data into OSM, ensuring its integrity every step of the way. Participants will master data conversion techniques to bridge the gap between external collection formats and OSM's structure. They will learn how to avoid duplicates and data loss while maintaining accuracy during upload using the JOSM editor. By the end, they will be equipped to confidently contribute valuable community data to OpenStreetMap and empower their fellow mappers.",
