Are you familiar with OpenStreetMap but want to take your geospatial skills to the next level? This workshop introduces you to the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo) and how its various software projects interact with OpenStreetMap data. This will help you to unlock new possibilities for analysis, visualization, and more.

Through a hands-on session using OSGeoLive, participants will:
- Explore OSGeo platforms like QGIS, PostGIS, and OpenLayers.
- Discover how these tools integrate with OpenStreetMap data through hands-on exercises.

The Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo) is a non-profit organization that promotes the global adoption of open geospatial technology. OSGeo is devoted to an open philosophy and participatory community-driven development and provides financial, organizational, and legal support to the larger open-source geospatial community.

OSGeo's vision is to make open-source geospatial software accessible to everyone. Founded in 2006, it is a well-established global organization with Local Chapters worldwide. It represents and supports over 25 software projects, such as QGIS, PostGIS, or GDAL.

The OSGeoLive project covers over 50 software projects, Open Data, documentation, and tutorials. OSGeoLive is a self-contained bootable DVD, USB thumb drive, or Virtual Machine based on Lubuntu that allows you to try a wide variety of open-source geospatial software without installing anything. OpenStreetMap data and software are also included on OSGeoLive.

OpenStreetMap data plays a significant role in numerous OSGeo projects, serving as sample data and service. The collaboration between OSGeo and OSM is evident in the variety of OSM-specific plugins for QGIS and the support for OSM in GDAL. This symbiotic relationship underscores the shared values and mutual benefits of the OSGeo and OSM communities.
