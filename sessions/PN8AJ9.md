This year, Every Door has gained plugins feature: you can customize the editor far beyond changing presets and lists. Sounds very technical, until you get to experience it first-hand. Every Door has always been about bringing control to the mapper, and this is another feature that makes you feel owning the map.

We will look at the feature, why it came about and what other options we have, explore some plugins other people have created, and maybe even write our own? And also, given that this work has been sponsored by NLNet Foundation, we'll learn how it is â€” working full-time on a grant.

When thinking about OSM plugins, only JOSM comes to mind: that editor is not only the longest existing and supported OSM editor ever, but also a huge part of its popularity is due to extensibility. Many people at some point made a plugin for it, just to try, or to implement some missing feature. Some of those went on to work on the editor core. Having a way to influence the software attracts developers, and I wanted that for Every Door. And also to get rid of all those &#34;in our country we map things different from the rest of the world, fix your editor please&#34;: now everyone can do that without waiting for the sole developer. Or just write an in-app snake game idk. I love how customization brings not only useful stuff, but also silly. Silly is what OpenStreetMap is missing. Let's talk about that.
