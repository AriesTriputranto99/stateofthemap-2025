## [Analyzing the Spatial Distribution of Fuel Stations in Harare, Zimbabwe: Leveraging OpenStreetMap for Disaster Preparedness, Mitigation and Recovery.](https://2024.stateofthemap.org/sessions/VFUBCD/)

### Kingsley Chika CHUKWU

Whether they are man-made or natural, disasters pose serious risks to communities all over the world. A comprehensive evaluation of gasoline station infrastructure is necessary to ensure public safety and reduce fire dangers. This research, which focuses on Harare, Zimbabwe, uses Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to examine building patterns and access building footprints, road networks, and public facilities using the OpenStreetMap Database. Fuel station mapping and dataset overlaying allow to define fire risk levels that are susceptible to fire hazards and identify danger zones. This study supports risk management, public safety, disaster preparedness, and mitigation initiatives in Harare, Zimbabwe.

## [Analysis of renewable energy infrastructure representations in OpenStreetMap](https://2024.stateofthemap.org/sessions/MKPJFW/)

### Luisa Lo Presti

The research evaluates the accuracy and completeness of wind and solar energy infrastructure data in OpenStreetMap (OSM) for Belgium and Ireland, identifying common mapping errors and proposing techniques to enrich available data. By combining OSM data with CORINE Land Cover inventory, we study land use patterns around renewable energy infrastructures, facilitating environmental planning.
