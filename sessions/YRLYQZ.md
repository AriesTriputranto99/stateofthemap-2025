In disaster situations, women and girls are the most affected and suffer drastic consequences during disasters. Therefore, in order to give women the tools to adaptively manage disasters in their country, this project aims to strengthen not only their skills in understanding and managing disasters, but also in using free mapping and spatial technologies to be resilient and proactive in the face of these disasters.

<hr>

The aim is to equip women to respond adaptively and proactively to natural disasters by integrating cartography. By reinforcing their skills in the use of GIS as a tool, they will be able to deal with current disaster-related problems in the city of Yaound√©. We are therefore training these women to use mapping tools (ID editor, JOSM, HOT Tasking Manager) and data collection tools (OsmAnd, Everydoor,ODK/KoboCollect), to use the data collected to propose concrete solutions to natural disasters using QGIS and JOSM.
