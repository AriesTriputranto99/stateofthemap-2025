The workshop is designed for beginner to intermediate mappers to better understand good practices and useful tools while performing data validation on OSM.
During the session it will be presented how to discover and interact with mappers in the area to be validated, as well as how to use JOSM plugins and web tools as ResultMaps, Osmose, Whodidit and OSMCha to analyze errors and changesets.
Participants are requested to bring their laptops and mouses to practice together. Basic understanding of JOSM is welcome but not necessary

The workshop is designed for beginner to intermediate mappers to better understand good practices, as well as useful tools, while performing data validation on OSM. 
We will see:
- Which types of error are most common, and how to best identify them (by using Osmose);
- How to communicate with other mappers while correcting data (OSM changeset comments, messages and forums);
- How to guess the level of expertise of a mapper (ResultMaps, Whosthat);
- How to read changesets and historical OSM data (Whodidit, OSMCha, .osh files);
- Performing validation on JOSM with simple Overpass queries;
Participants are requested to bring their laptops and mouses to practice together. Basic understanding of JOSM is welcome but not necessary. The workshop will be composed by a presentation of the topics and an hands-on session in which participants will  practice what they learned on an area with data to be validated.
