Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionize the way we think about mapping. It has provided us with quick and advanced tools that helps in map the unmapped. An example of OpenStreetMap (OSM), has several AI-assisted mapping projects that enhances the applications that these data been used for. Despite these advances there are several ethical challenges that arise because of this uncontrolled use of AI due to the different end-use. In this session I would like to take few of these challenges and discuss what are the possible policy options available.

As more and more AI becomes part of our lives and making our lives more easier. With advert of GenAI, the menial tasks can easily be done. AI is also contributing in mapping the unmapped places using advance machine learning techniques. These advancement brings ease in our lives but at the same time it bring several ethical and justice related questions. AI for many still a black box and brings even fear on what it can do. For example, the mapping practices using AI can help built a large number of data bases but at the same time cannot control who and how these database will be utilized. Such data bases if not controlled can cause more harm then it can cause benefits. The main ethical question that will be discuss here is &#34;where does it stop?&#34; and what are policy recommendation can be there to the AI in the field of automated mapping?.
