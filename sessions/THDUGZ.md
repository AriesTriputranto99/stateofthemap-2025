OSM has long been thought of as a great way to provide maps for development purposes in sectors like health, sanitation, and education. But what have been the most promising outcomes of OSM mapping in development agencies, and what have been their greatest challenges and failures? This panel will bring together representatives with many years experience using OSM data to inform decision making and programs in large development agencies globally. Expect panelists from USAID, World Bank, and others to delve into specific examples, particularly on the African continent, where the great promise of improving peopleâ€™s lives with open maps has been tested over the course of over a decade.
