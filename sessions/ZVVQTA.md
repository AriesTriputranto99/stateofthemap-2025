Importing a government-release open data dataset is an important data source for OpenStreetMap. I will talk about the experience of the OpenStreetMap Taiwan community importing tasks. I will describe the methods and the challenges we face during the whole import process. We have already dealt with 9 counties and cities' address datasets, and looking forward to dealing with more datasets released by other local government agencies in the future.

Importing a government-release open data dataset is an important data source for OpenStreetMap. Most of the time you have to judge if the data quality is good enough to do so, and once you decide to import, you have to convert the dataset's field into the correspondent tags of OpenStreetMap. I will talk about the experience of the OpenStreetMap Taiwan community importing the open data datasets of addresses from the Taiwan government. I will describe the methods and the challenges we face during the whole import process. We have already dealt with 9 counties and cities' address datasets, and looking forward to dealing with more datasets released by other local government agencies in the future.

I will report 6 cities and  3 counties importing address tasks. And talk about the experience of previous import tasks, like importing ETC tolls, public bicycle stations, bus stops, etc.
