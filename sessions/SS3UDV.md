The experience of organizing the two recent SotM LATAM (2024, 2025) has been both rewarding and enriching, both personally and communally, and has also allowed us to take the temperature of the OSM Latam community in various aspects. After collecting, analyzing, and comparing data, here we bring you a brief report of these events that somewhat summarizes the main characteristics of the Latin American OSM community. After this analysis, it was interesting to subsequently attempt a comparison with the SotM Global event and find some substantial differences. This led us to outline hypotheses as to why we believe such differences exist.

The experience of organizing the two recent SotM LATAM (2024, 2025) has been both rewarding and enriching, both personally and communally, and has also allowed us to take the temperature of the OSM Latam community in various aspects. After collecting, analyzing, and comparing data, here we bring you a brief report of these events that somewhat summarizes the main characteristics of the Latin American OSM community. 

This analysis includes: 
- SotM general review 2024 - 2025.
- Overview of the participating community in the regional SOTM (country of origin, identified topics of interest, identified learning needs, geographic gaps, thematic gaps)
-Ecosystem of tools that are being most used in the region and how they are being used
-What the Latin American community can teach the global community and what it wants to learn from the global community
-Important alliances that the Latin American community already has and how resources are being managed
-Proposals for articulation with the global community
-Challenges future SOTM Latam will face
-Is there a more active role for OSMF to play on this?

After this analysis, it was interesting to subsequently attempt a comparison with the SotM Global event and find some substantial differences. This led us to outline hypotheses as to why we believe such differences exist.
