About work on reducing one of minor problems of OpenStreetMap: rare, unclear and confusing tag values. Such as for example shop=miÄ™sny

How cleanup of such tags may help? Why it is dangerous to make this kind of edits? How it can be useful and how it can be problematic or annoying?

How it can be done so benefits are much greater than damages?

What kind of help would be welcome?
