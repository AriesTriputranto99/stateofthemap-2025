In this presentation, we will share our experience conducting an OpenStreetMap training program with the Kibera Girls' Soccer Academy in Kenya. We will cover various aspects such as the planning process, development of curriculum, hands-on mapping activities, and achieved outcomes. Our aim is to provide practical insights that attendees can use to run similar programs in other schools or regions, promoting greater OpenStreetMap engagement among youth.

In 2022, Map Kibera collaborated with YouthMappers to launch and manage a technical training program for an all-girls secondary school in Kenya. The training program primarily focused on OpenStreetMap (OSM) but also included sessions on career guidance and digital wellbeing to introduce the students to STEM.

In this session, we aim to share the resources that were used to model how OSM communities and organizations can join forces with secondary schools to conduct impactful training programs. We will also emphasize the significance of OpenStreetMap in developing technical skills and advocating for STEM education in young learners. Additionally, we will include how such programs promote inclusivity and the strategies to make training programs accessible and encouraging, especially for girls in marginalized communities.

The attendees will gain a better understanding of the steps involved in planning an OpenStreetMap training program for high school students and acquire insights into customizing mapping activities to cater to a younger audience.
