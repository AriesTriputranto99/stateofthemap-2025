In this paper, I share my journey as a Computer Science student at Eastern University, Bangladesh, and the General Secretary of Eastern University YouthMappers, as I explore the impactful world of OpenStreetMap (OSM). My engagement with OSM began in May 2024 through participation in the OSMBD Mapathon. Since then, I have expanded my involvement by contributing to international mapathons, attending professional training sessions, and participating in global conferences such as State of the Map Asia 2024. Through these experiences, I have gained practical expertise in various open mapping tools, including JOSM, QGIS, and Overpass Turbo, and have earned multiple certifications along the way. My participation in the Open Mapping Guru Project has further strengthened my understanding of open data, community-driven mapping, and the application of geospatial information for humanitarian and development purposes. This paper aims to highlight how open mapping fosters collaboration, builds capacity, and contributes to the achievement of sustainable development goals. I also seek to encourage institutional recognition of open mapping as a powerful tool for education, civic engagement, and global problem-solving.

This article shares my journey as Bayazid Ahmed, a Computer Science and Engineering student at Eastern University, Bangladesh, and Treasurer of YouthMappers. I began my engagement with OpenStreetMap (OSM) in May 2024 through a national mapathon organized by OpenStreetMap Bangladesh. Since then, I have grown into an enthusiastic contributor to open mapping efforts.

My involvement has expanded from local events to international platforms, including the Open Mapping Guru Project and the State of the Map Asia 2024 conference. Through professional training, I have gained skills in open-source mapping tools like JOSM, QGIS, Overpass Turbo, and Canva.

I actively participate in humanitarian mapping, data visualization, and spatial analysis to support community development and disaster response. My work promotes the use of open geospatial data to advance the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

This article highlights how open mapping fosters innovation, collaboration, and civic engagement. I hope it encourages institutions to recognize the value of open mapping as a powerful tool for education, development, and global problem-solving.
