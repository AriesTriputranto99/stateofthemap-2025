## [CRISIS MAPPING: TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL ELL STUDENTS HOW TO MAKE MAPS THAT SAVE LIVES](https://2024.stateofthemap.org/sessions/NQHRLV/)

### Dr. Joel Thomas

This paper presents the learning outcomes of a Mini-Mapathon course developed, implemented, and evaluated for the first time in a population of 28 Asian Junior high school ELL students in three Human Geography courses at an international high school. The paper includes an introduction to crisis mapping and concludes with an analysis of students’ knowledge and skill gains, and attitudes towards map making. Students’ survey responses were analyzed using mixed methods. In conclusion, the paper proposes that the Mini-Mapathon course could be implemented in other schools with a larger sample size to investigate learning outcomes.

Following a theoretical and methodological analysis of the scientific literature on PGIS, this study aims to explore the unexplored potential of the connections between PGIS (using OSM) and digital humanitarianism, as well as the empirical references from a case study in Morocco.
