UN Maps is an initiative from the Department of Operational Support at the United Nations which aims not only to enrich topographic and operational data in UN mission areas but also to provide peacekeeping and humanitarian actors with topographic maps, operational geo-information, search and navigation tools, and imagery and street-level base maps. UN Maps is built on both UN internal authoritative geospatial information and open data, especially OpenStreetMap. UN Maps has also built a thriving community, called UN Mappers, around the collection and validation of open geospatial data with contributors from local communities, academia and UN staff in the field.
