Thousands of Linked [Open] Data sources and knowledge graphs allow to access an enormous amount of structured interconnected data with built in interoperability. This talk explains the basics of Linked Data and offers an overview about the potential its combination with OSM has and the most popular methods available for linking, extracting, combining and querying data from OSM and Linked Data sources.

Linked Data defines data structured with design principles that make it easily interoperable. Thousands of Linked [Open] Data sources and knowledge graphs around the world allow to access an enormous amount of structured interconnected data. The combination of this data with OpenStreetMap has considerable potential for valuable insights, quality control and new methods of interaction. This talk explores the basics of Linked Data and offers an overview of the state of the art in methods for mapping links to Linked Data sources and for extracting, combining and querying their data.
