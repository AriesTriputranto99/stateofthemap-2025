**A picture is worth a thousand words**, I am a Pharmacists by training and only discovered the love for technology and maps recently. After discovering OpenStreetMap and taking up mapping based on interest. I share my experience, motivation and how I have used photos to improve OpenStreetMap data in Accra.

<hr>

I joined OpenStreetMap in 2018 but it was only until recently that I finally found much interest in the project and community. In this presentation, I share with you my experience contributing to OpenStreetMap as a Pharmacist. I also will talk about interesting discoveries and observations whilst collecting data for mapping into OSM. Finally, I share my workflow and current projects.
