MapLibre Tiles (MLT) is a new vector tiles format which offers a significant tile size reduction and accelerated decoding performance compared to the de-facto standard Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVT). MLT also adds support for missing features like nested properties, linear referencing and M-values. Our evaluation against MVT on a OpenMapTiles schema based OSM tileset shows a reduction in tile size of nearly up to 80% with even faster decoding times. This talk explains how MLT can be used in combination with OSM data and the advantages it offers.
