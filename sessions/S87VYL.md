Ensuring public safety and mitigating fire hazards require a thorough assessment of fuel station infrastructure. Focused on Harare, Zimbabwe, this study employs Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to analyze construction practices, building footprints, and road networks. By mapping fuel stations and overlaying datasets, we identify hazard zones and classify fire risk levels. Leveraging Euclidean and buffer analyses, we pinpoint vulnerable areas and propose mitigation strategies. Our spatial distribution analysis enhances decision-making for stakeholders and aims to minimize the impact of fire disasters. This research contributes to public safety efforts and risk management in Harare, Zimbabwe.

The assessment of fuel station infrastructure is paramount in ensuring public safety and minimizing risks associated with fire hazards. In this study, we focus on Harare, Zimbabwe, utilizing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) methodologies to analyze standard construction practices, building footprints, and road networks to identify hazard zones.
The methodology involves mapping fuel stations by acquiring their coordinates, fire station and extracting road networks and building footprints from the OpenStreetMap database. These datasets are then overlaid using GIS Software, followed by GIS analysis to identify hotspots and conduct Euclidean and nearest neighbor analyses.
The outcomes of these analyses aid in classifying fire hazard risk zones into categories of very high, high, medium, low, and no risk. By leveraging Euclidean and buffer analyses, in conjunction with location and guidelines for siting and constructing fuel stations in Zimbabwe, we aim to identify buildings or households within each fire hazard risk zone.
This spatial distribution analysis provides valuable insights into the distribution of fuel stations in Harare and their proximity to fire stations. Fire disaster, akin to other natural disasters, poses significant risks to life and property. Poor management of such disasters can result in loss of lives and properties.
This study aims to mitigate risks by providing stakeholders with essential information for decision-making and risk management. By identifying disaster zones and proposing effective solutions, we strive to enhance public safety and minimize the impact of fire disasters in Harare, Zimbabwe.
