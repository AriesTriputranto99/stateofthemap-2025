Minetest Classroom is a free and open source (https://github.com/ubc-minetest-classroom/minetest_classroom) educational, voxel-based sandbox video game that supports the ability to create digital twins from geospatial data, including OpenStreetMap data. In this hands-on workshop, you will learn how to create your own walking tour from OpenStreetMap data with this powerful game. Participants will be able to join a multiplayer server and experience an OpenStreetMap world first-hand. We will also discuss possible lesson plans for teachers looking to engage students with OpenStreetMap, the possibilities for multi-sensory video game cartography more generally, and the future of creating an OpenStreetMap editor in a video game.
