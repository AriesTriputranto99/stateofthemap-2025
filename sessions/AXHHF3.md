This highly engaging workshop will focus on providing participants with the fundamental knowledge and practical skills required to produce exceptional quality maps utilizing OpenStreetMap (OSM) data in QGIS. Attendees will gain an in-depth understanding of how to create an atlas, which will be a compilation of maps that portray a specific geographical area, by harnessing the power of OSM data. The workshop will be designed to provide a comprehensive overview of the entire process involved in atlas creation, ranging from acquiring OSM data, developing a base map, incorporating layers and labels, and ultimately exporting the final product. Whether you're an experienced cartographer seeking to enhance your skills or a novice looking to learn new techniques, this workshop will promise to provide you with valuable insights and hands-on experience to help you create stunning maps that will captivate and engage your audience.

Expected Outcome
By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to produce high-quality maps with OSM data in QGIS. They will be familiar with the complete process of creating an atlas, from downloading OSM data, creating a base map, adding layers and labels, and exporting the final product. They will also learn how to customize their maps by adding dynamic text and images, and how to create a map template for future projects.

Target Audience
This workshop is suitable for beginners and intermediate users of QGIS and OSM data who are interested in map production. It is ideal for professionals, students, and researchers who want to create batch high-quality maps in a single click for their projects or publications.
