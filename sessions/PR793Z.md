Swiggy is an Indian online food ordering and delivery platform. We are scaling the road network on Swiggy’s private map to reduce dependence on Google Maps and drive efficiency. With OSM, we built a strong foundation layer to store and edit the road input we receive. Our contributions to OSM and the Map Editor tool powered by OSM helped us decrease workload by 3 person days per week. We have saved significant money in delivery partner fees and reduced food delivery time for orders by 33%.

Bundl Technologies Private Limited, an online marketplace in the name of Swiggy (hereinafter referred to as ‘Swiggy’), is an Indian online platform that enables a transaction between participant restaurants/merchants, delivery partners, and customers/ consumers. Swiggy mainly offers food delivery, on-demand grocery deliveries, and a same-day package delivery service through its app and operates in over 500 Indian cities. Previously, Google Maps was used to track delivery partners on various platforms. In Swiggy’s quest to reduce dependence on Google Maps to drive efficiency, we are scaling the road network on Swiggy Maps with the help of OSM.

The Swiggy Maps team contributes to OpenStreetMap coverage of various cities in India. Our focus is on improving road networks by editing road geometry from OSM evidence, ground truth, publicly available sources, and internal trip summaries. Our purpose for OSM editing is to improve the road network where Swiggy operates and uses the data.
We also build a private foundation layer to store and edit the road input we receive from our delivery partners. Towards this goal, we created a Map Editor Tool to enable the team to facilitate maximum accuracy of geographical data.
Swiggy would like to be part of the OSM community and help improve road coverage. In places where road geometry might not be accurate or might not have full road coverage, Swiggy plans to improve this map/road data through our knowledge of ground truth to benefit OSM. 

The speakers worked on designing Swiggy's Map Editor tool and facilitating contributions to OSM from a team of 10 developers. In this talk, we want to discuss how we used OSM to replace Google Maps from our system to reduce business costs and increase food delivery efficiency through the app. Based on what we learned from this project, we also want to discuss the state of OSM in India's context and what we need from the map here.
